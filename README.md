This is an  Android app developed by Francisco Miranda.

All data created is used by the app only. The app does not store any data. When the app is off the data is lost. 
The user can make phone calls but user data is not transmitted off device in the call.
The app does not send any user's data.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any questions regarding 
how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will fix it.

Yours sincerely,

Francisco Miranda
